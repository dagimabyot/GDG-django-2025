# GDG Week 3 – Python OOP Practice Tasks

This folder contains all Python practice tasks for **Week 3** of the GDG Django course, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## Review Questions

### 1. Person Class
- Create a class `Person` with attributes `name` and `age`.
- Make an object and print its attributes.

### 2. Dog Class
- Create a class `Dog` with a method `bark()` that prints `"Woof!"`.
- Create a dog object and call `bark()`.

### 3. Car Class
- Create a class `Car` with attribute `make`.
- Add a method `get_make()` that returns the make.
- Test it with an object.

### 4. Rectangle Class
- Create a class `Rectangle` with `width` and `height`.
- Print the area (without adding a separate method).

### 5. Student Class
- Create a class `Student` with a private attribute `__grade`.
- Add methods `set_grade()` and `get_grade()`.

- Test by adding a few books and displaying them.

### 8. Animal & Cat Classes (Inheritance)
- Create a base class `Animal` and a child class `Cat`.
- Add a `make_sound()` method for each.
- Test by calling the method on both objects.

### 9. Vehicle → Car (Method Overriding)
- Create a base class `Vehicle` with `brand` and `year`.
- Create a child class `Car` that adds `model`.
- Override a method `info()` in `Car`.
- Test `info()` for both classes.

### 10. BankAccount Class
